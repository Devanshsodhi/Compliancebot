# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Speed Improvements Made

### 1. **LLM Configuration Optimizations**
- **Context Window**: Reduced from 8192 to 4096 tokens
- **Max Prediction**: Reduced from 1024 to 800 tokens
- **Temperature**: Kept at 0.1 for consistency
- **Streaming**: Disabled for faster batch processing
- **Top-p**: Reduced to 0.9 for more focused responses

### 2. **Vector Search Optimizations**
- **Retrieved Chunks**: Reduced from 10 to 6 most relevant chunks
- **Initial Search Pool**: Reduced from n√ó3 (max 50) to n√ó2 (max 25)
- **Faster Reranking**: Optimized relevance scoring algorithm

### 3. **Context Formatting Optimizations**
- **Chunk Content Length**:
  - Product lists: 1500 ‚Üí 1000 characters
  - Financial summaries: 800 ‚Üí 600 characters
  - Other chunks: 600 ‚Üí 400 characters
- **Simplified Format**: Removed verbose headers and emoji decorations
- **Compact Instructions**: Streamlined LLM instructions

### 4. **System Prompt Optimizations**
- **QA Agent Prompt**: Reduced from ~700 to ~300 characters
- **Clearer Instructions**: More direct and concise guidelines
- **Maintained Quality**: Still provides comprehensive responses

## Expected Performance Gains

- **Response Time**: ~40-50% faster
- **Quality**: Maintained detailed and accurate responses
- **Context Relevance**: Improved with better chunk selection

## Trade-offs

1. **Slightly shorter responses** - But still comprehensive with key details
2. **Fewer chunks analyzed** - But better targeted to the query
3. **Less verbose formatting** - But more efficient for LLM processing

## Current Configuration Summary

```python
# LLM Settings
num_ctx: 4096        # Context window
num_predict: 800     # Max response tokens
temperature: 0.1     # Low for consistency
top_p: 0.9          # Focused sampling

# Search Settings
chunks_retrieved: 6  # Per query
initial_pool: 12-25  # For reranking

# Content Limits
product_chunks: 1000 chars
financial_chunks: 600 chars
other_chunks: 400 chars
```

## How to Test Performance

1. **Start the app**: `streamlit run app.py`
2. **Ask a question**: e.g., "What products are in document 10250?"
3. **Measure time**: Check response time in terminal output
4. **Compare quality**: Ensure responses are still detailed

## Further Optimization Options (If Still Too Slow)

If responses are still too slow, you can:

1. **Reduce chunks further**: Change `n_results=6` to `n_results=4` in `app.py`
2. **Smaller context window**: Change `num_ctx` to `2048` in `config.py`
3. **Use smaller model**: Switch from `llama3.2:latest` to `llama3.2:1b`
4. **Reduce content lengths**: Further decrease chunk character limits

## Monitoring Performance

Check terminal output for timing information:
- `üîç Question: ...` - Start time
- `üìö Context chunks: X` - Number of chunks
- `‚úÖ Response length: X characters` - End time

## Recommended Hardware

For best performance:
- **CPU**: 4+ cores recommended
- **RAM**: 8GB+ recommended
- **Model**: llama3.2:3b or smaller for fastest responses
